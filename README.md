# Internet Manager
## What is it and why?
Basically I wanted an automated system that cut-off my internet reliably to enforce a strict bedtime, but also had the flexibility to delay that cut-off on occassion. So, I made this program that has a server and gui componenets. 
When the server is running all the functionality of internet manager is active, aka your internet connection will be cut at the configured times. The gui component allows the user to then visualize when the next cut off is as well as use the built in 'voucher' system to delay their impending cut-off.
Audio also can be configured to play to warn the user that a cut-off/shutdown is imminent. Regardless, the design is meant to be something that keeps the user informed, while allowing for a fairly strict, but slightly lenient internet shutdown experience.
### How to set up
Will get to eventually
